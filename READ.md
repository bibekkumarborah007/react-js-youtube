07:
//props: makes component reusable: when a cart made keep it in component and keep resuse it.
//Generally we keep html, css, js in specifically based on tech. 
// Reacts says instead of segregating based on technologies but segregate on the basis of what it work and what written inside. eg. like a card in order to reuse it put all html,css,js inside it so that when we pass a value inside it the card changes. 



//props: value can be send from one component to another with porps access eg card prop pass here and handle it in component
